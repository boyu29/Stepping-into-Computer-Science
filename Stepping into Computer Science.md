# Stepping into Computer Science



## Introduction

If you have some basic experience like finishing programming courses at school, personally I don't think it is necessary to take this introduction course again.

## Professional Skills Required for My Internship

I'm doing interships during my gap year and my work requires python programming skills. I'm not familiar with python so I registered a python programming course in Coursera.
